# wheat-detection

This is a repository for the code used in the Global Wheat Detection challenge hosted by University of Saskatchewan at Kaggle. 

The method used was a faster-RCNN with a resnet backbone. Data augmentation was used to counter the small dataset. Pseudo labeling was also implemented to further improve the algorithm.
